# 🐊 MVC_Lab — Snap Into Some Code!

Welcome to the **MVC_Lab** swamp — where controllers swim, models crawl, and views bite with style! This project is part of my .NET MVC learning journey at ITI. Dive in, and watch out for wild `HttpPost` methods and lurking `ViewBags`!

## 🐊 What's Inside the Swamp?

This repo is built on the classic ASP.NET MVC architecture, featuring:
- **Controllers**: Like crocodile brains — handling logic and hunting routes.
- **Models**: Data structures that slither in and out of your database.
- **Views**: The scaly UI that users interact with (careful, it bites).
